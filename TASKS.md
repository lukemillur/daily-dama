# Tasks

Working backlog for Daily Dama **core-functionality** work. This file is the checkpoint mechanism: a session — including a fresh one after context compaction — reads it top to bottom to know what's done, what's next, and how to verify it, instead of relying on conversation memory or a todo list that only exists in-context.

**Scope note:** Trick visualization (`src/features/trick-viz/`) is intentionally excluded from this file right now. Its own backlog lives in [TRICK_VIZ_HANDOFF.md](TRICK_VIZ_HANDOFF.md) §15. Do not pull items from there into this file unless explicitly told to resume that thread.

**Automation note:** [TASKS_BACKLOG.md](TASKS_BACKLOG.md) holds scoped, ready-to-work tasks that are deliberately kept out of this file so the `newTicket` workflow (`.claude/skills/newTicket/SKILL.md`) never claims, plans, or implements them automatically. Moving an entry between the two files is a deliberate human decision, not something to do as a side effect of other work.

## How to use this file

**Picking up work:**

1. Read this file top to bottom before touching code.
2. Take the first `Backlog` entry with status `Not started` or `In progress`. Before claiming it, follow the branch-check protocol in _Working across multiple agents_ below — this file's status field is a human-readable picture, not the authoritative claim signal.
3. Read its exit criteria before writing anything — that's the definition of done, not a vibe check.
4. If the exit criteria depend on something no longer true (file moved, API changed, decision superseded), stop and flag it rather than guessing.

**Completing a task:**

1. Do the work.
2. Run the task's own exit criteria yourself — don't mark it done on assumption.
3. Run the project's standard verification sequence (`yarn test --runInBand`, `yarn lint`, `yarn tsc --noEmit` — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)). A task isn't done if it breaks the baseline, even when its own criteria pass.
4. Commit the change on its own, referencing the task ID in the message. Focused commits, never pushed automatically (see AGENTS.md § Git state expectations).
5. In that same commit, move the entry from `Backlog` in this file to [TASKS_DONE.md](TASKS_DONE.md), flipping its status to `Done`. If this task was the last remaining child of a parent umbrella entry (every sibling child is now `Done`), move the parent entry to `TASKS_DONE.md` as well, in the same commit, flipping its status to `Done` too — an umbrella with no exit criteria of its own is done exactly when its children are.
6. Open a PR into `development` and squash-merge it immediately — no review gate, this is pre-authorized (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) § Git state expectations). `development`, not `main`, is where task branches land; promoting `development` into `main` is a separate, manual step outside this protocol.

**Getting stuck:**

- If a task turns out bigger than scoped, don't silently expand it. Split it into new entries and mark the original `Blocked` with a one-line reason.
- If a task depends on a product decision, mark it `Blocked` with the specific open question, not a guess — but this should be rare in practice. See _Scoping a task_ below: most decisions should already have been surfaced and resolved before an entry ever reached `Backlog`.

## Status legend

- `Not started`
- `In progress` — being actively worked. If you find a task already in this state at the start of a session, verify how far it actually got (check the commit log) rather than trusting the label alone.
- `Blocked` — reason required, one line, specific enough to unblock without a meeting.
- `Done` — moved to [TASKS_DONE.md](TASKS_DONE.md), not left in Backlog.

## Task template

Copy this shape for every new entry. Keep exit criteria mechanical — a test that passes, a command that exits 0, a specific behavior checked in-browser — never "looks right" or "seems fine."

```
### [T###] Short imperative title

- **Area:** e.g. Sesh, Stats, Tricks, persistence, navigation
- **Priority:** High / Medium / Low
- **Status:** Not started
- **Planning:** Required / Implementer
- **Description:** What changes and why, in 1-3 sentences — enough for a fresh session to start without re-deriving intent.
- **Exit criteria:** Mechanical and checkable.
- **Notes:** Assumptions made, decisions deferred, anything a resuming session needs to know.
```

### The Planning field

`Planning` decides whether the [newTicket workflow](.claude/skills/newTicket/SKILL.md) spends a separate high-rigor planning pass on the task before implementing it.

- **`Required`** — run the separate planner and keep its durable plan at `.claude/plans/<ID>.md`. Use this for persistence or schema changes, state-machine and concurrency work, changes that move an architectural boundary, unfamiliar native/platform APIs, and anything where being wrong is expensive to undo.
- **`Implementer`** — the implementer writes a short plan for itself and gets straight to work. Use this for genuinely local S-sized tickets: one or two files, a known pattern, no open questions.

Rules that hold regardless of what an entry says:

- **Omitting the field is safe.** An entry with no `Planning` line gets the separate planner, so every pre-existing task keeps its old behavior.
- **Priority is not complexity.** A High-priority label change is still `Implementer`; a Low-priority reducer change is still `Required`.
- **The workflow can escalate but never de-escalate.** An entry marked `Implementer` whose title, area, description or notes name persistence, schema/migration, reducers/state machines/concurrency, architectural boundaries, or native/iOS/Android APIs is promoted back to the separate planner automatically, and the run says so.

## Scoping a task

Rough ideas do not go straight into `Backlog`. They land in `Needs scoping` first, and only get promoted once they pass every check below. This is a rigid gate on purpose — a vaguely-scoped entry sitting in `Backlog` is worse than no entry, because it looks actionable and isn't.

**Promotion checklist — an idea may move to `Backlog` only if all four are true:**

1. **Single area.** It stays inside one feature area or persistence domain (see AGENTS.md's three domains — profile, custom tricks, practice history — and the Sesh/Stats/Tricks/navigation split). If it spans two, split it into one entry per area.
2. **One exit criterion.** The definition of done is a single coherent verification of _one_ behavior or change — it can involve running a whole suite or several related checks together, as long as they're all confirming the same thing. What doesn't fit: bolting on verification of a second, unrelated behavior ("and also verify X") — that's a second task wearing one entry's clothes.
3. **No embedded decision.** If answering it requires a product or technical call only you can make, it is not ready — it goes to `Blocked` with the specific open question, not into `Not started` with an assumption baked in.

   Push on this _during scoping itself_, not after. While an idea sits in `Needs scoping`, actively hunt for any product or technical question it raises and get it answered in that conversation. The goal is for `Blocked` to be rare and reserved for questions that only became visible during implementation — not a routine landing spot for decisions that could've been asked about in five seconds while scoping.

4. **One commit.** The whole thing lands in a single focused commit. If it can't, it isn't one task — see sizing below.

If an idea fails any check, either split it into entries that each pass all four, or resolve the open question first. Don't force a fit.

**Sizing — by checkpoint count, not duration:**

- **S — single commit.** One exit criterion, one commit. This is the target size; most `Backlog` entries should be S.
- **M — a chain of S's.** Only for genuinely sequential steps that can't be reordered or done independently. Written as a parent entry (`[T010]`) plus numbered children (`[T010.1]`, `[T010.2]`, ...), each S-sized with its own exit criteria. The parent is an umbrella only — it has no exit criteria of its own and is marked `Done` when every child is `Done`.

Nothing else is a valid size. An idea that doesn't reduce to S or a numbered M-chain isn't scoped yet — leave it in `Needs scoping` and keep discussing it rather than forcing it into a template.

## Working across multiple agents

Tasks here may be picked up by more than one agent at a time — possibly different harnesses, possibly different machines. Real-time coordination happens through git, not through this file: a pushed branch is the authoritative claim, and this file's `Status` field is the human-readable picture that catches up whenever that branch eventually merges. Don't trust `Status` alone to mean a task is actually free.

**Before claiming a task:**

1. Pull latest `development`.
2. Check whether a branch already exists for it: `git ls-remote origin 'refs/heads/task/T0NN-*'` (substitute the real ID, e.g. `T003` or a child like `T005.1`). If one exists, it's already claimed — pick a different task.
3. If the task notes a dependency (e.g. T013 depends on T012), confirm that dependency is actually in [TASKS_DONE.md](TASKS_DONE.md), not just referenced as resolved in a conversation. From another agent's perspective, only a merged, archived task is really done.

**Claiming and working:**

1. Create a branch named `task/T0NN-short-slug`, using the task's own ID, branched from `development`.
2. Push the branch immediately, _before_ starting the actual work — this push is the claim (see the narrow exception to "never push automatically" in AGENTS.md § Git state expectations). If the push is rejected because the branch name already exists, someone beat you to it — stop and pick another task. Never `--force` here; a rejected push is the collision detector working as intended, not an obstacle to push through.
3. Do the work on that branch. Everything under _Completing a task_ above still applies — including that moving the entry to `TASKS_DONE.md` happens in a commit on this branch, not a direct edit on `development`.
4. Open a PR into `development` when ready and squash-merge it immediately — this is pre-authorized, no review gate (see AGENTS.md § Git state expectations). CI runs the standard verification sequence on the PR, but the merge itself does not wait on it.
5. Pushing further commits to your own branch, opening the PR, and squash-merging it into `development` are all covered by working normally on a task. Promoting `development` into `main` is a separate, manual step and still needs the usual confirmation.

**Stale claims:** a pushed branch with no activity and no PR is an abandoned claim, not a real one. Deleting it releases the task — ordinary git housekeeping, no special protocol required. Deleting it is a deliberate human decision: no agent or script may take over a claim branch on its own, and branch age is never treated as proof that a claim was abandoned.

**Resuming your own interrupted task:** if a run stopped partway — a usage limit, a crashed session — the claim branch and any committed `.claude/plans/<ID>.md` are still there, and that's exactly what recovery uses. Resume it explicitly with `/newTicket resume T0NN`. Resuming reads the branch, never rewrites it: it stops with a blocker if no branch matches the ID, if more than one does, or if the branch doesn't actually contain that task. If a durable plan is on the branch, implementation continues from it instead of planning again.

**Claiming is scripted, not improvised.** `node .claude/scripts/ticket-claim.mjs` performs selection, the dependency check, the collision check, the branch, the status flip, the claim commit and the claim push, inside a temporary worktree it removes itself. It never force-pushes, never deletes a branch it doesn't own, and never touches the checkout it's invoked from. Run it with `--dry-run` to see which task would be picked without changing anything.

## Needs scoping

_Raw ideas land here — a name and a one-line description, nothing more. Discuss and apply the promotion checklist above before moving an entry down to Backlog._

- **First-lace "extra flashy" tiering** (Medium, follow-on to T008) — escalate the celebration based on time/attempts/sessions spent before landing; thresholds undefined.
- **Competition mode** (Low) — trick lists by competition skill level, portable into sesh mode.
- **Longest-grind-per-trick metric** (Low) — time-to-first-lace per trick; display surface (Stats?) undecided.
- **Double-digit lace animation** (Low) — animation design undefined.
- **Buzzer-beater lace animation** (Low) — landing with under 10s remaining; threshold is clear, animation design is not.
- **Time-of-day success correlation** (Low) — surface whether the user lands more in morning vs. night seshes; what counts as a meaningful difference is undefined.
- **Line generator** (Low) — random line of tricks; trick pool source (all / unlocked / selected) undecided.
- **Collection management** (Low) — photos + metadata for physical kendama collection, with kendama-specific lace lists. Likely a new persistence domain; substantial scope on its own.

## Backlog

_This round came out of a review pass over the first batch of completed work (T001–T014). Entries below are either defects in what shipped or follow-on functionality that first pass surfaced. Where an entry corrects a completed task, it names that task — but the archived entry in [TASKS_DONE.md](TASKS_DONE.md) stays as-written; history isn't rewritten._

_T112–T112.6 come from stories S027–S031 in [BACKLOG_STORIES.md](BACKLOG_STORIES.md) (a dedicated pre-app landing page), refined by `product-manager` from a direct user request and scoped in this pass. T111 (drop the access-gate password screen) isn't from a story — it's a decision made during this scoping conversation, in answer to a question the landing-page work raised directly: the app is currently gated behind a password on every route, which defeats the purpose of a publicly shareable landing page, and the user chose to remove the gate outright rather than scope it to just `/app`. T111 is listed first because T112.1 assumes it's already gone, though nothing technically blocks doing them in the other order. T112.1 is the foundation the rest of T112's children build on — it does the actual `/app` route nesting — so it's sequenced first within the umbrella._

_T113–T120 come from stories S001–S008 in [BACKLOG_STORIES.md](BACKLOG_STORIES.md) (the user's 2026-08-19 QA pass on T112.4/T112.6 plus general landing-page feedback), refined by `product-manager` and scoped in this pass. T117 is a two-child umbrella: T117.1 captures new web-layout screenshots (mirroring T112.3's dedicated capture task) and T117.2 wires the platform-based swap, split because the capture step is genuinely separable in risk and effort from the display-logic change. Two open product questions surfaced during scoping and were resolved here rather than left `Blocked`: T114 moves the CTA to the top rather than duplicating it, and T120 clears background/accent only (not text color), matching the existing "Reset background & accent" button's scope. All other entries are independent S-sized tickets — no required ordering between them beyond what each entry's own Notes call out.

_T121–T131 come from stories S001–S011 in [BACKLOG_STORIES.md](BACKLOG_STORIES.md) (the user's 2026-08-20 QA pass on T115–T120 plus general landing-page feedback), refined by `product-manager` and scoped in this pass. T123 is a two-child umbrella: T123.1 builds and validates the looping, text-bearing Big Cup scene in the trick-viz sandbox in isolation, and T123.2 wires it into the production landing page with a WebGL fallback — split because validating a wholly new capability (3D text, autoplay looping) in isolation is a different risk profile from integrating it into a page every visitor loads, mirroring how T117 split screenshot capture from display-logic wiring. Three product questions surfaced during S003's refinement were resolved before scoping rather than left `Blocked`: the hero is decorative-only (no drag/orbit/tap interaction), needs a static-image fallback for visitors whose browser can't run WebGL, and does not need to respect `prefers-reduced-motion` this iteration. All other entries are independent S-sized tickets — no required ordering between them beyond what each entry's own Notes call out (T124 and T128 both touch landing-page desktop sizing but are independent of each other; T131 references T130's corrected animation duration but has no hard git-level dependency on it)._

### [T129] Redesign trick goal cards to match the app's visual identity

- **Area:** Goals
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Not started
- **Planning:** Required
- **Description:** `GoalCard` (`src/features/goals/components/trick-goals-screen.tsx:253`) is a single-line styled component (flat background, plain border, padding) with no rounded corners, shadow, or accent treatment, unlike `CtaPanel`/`ScreenshotItem` elsewhere in the app. Restyle it to match the app's established sticker-style visual language (rounded corners, bold border/shadow, and/or color accents) without changing what information it shows.
- **Exit criteria:** Trick goal cards render with rounded corners and a bold/shadow-style border consistent with `CtaPanel`'s treatment; all existing goal information (trick name, progress) still renders correctly. `yarn test --runInBand` passes.
- **Notes:** Visual treatment only — no change to goal data, progress calculation, or the goals reducer.

### [T130] Slow down the CTA entrance animation

- **Area:** Landing page
- **Priority:** Low
- **Status:** Not started
- **Planning:** Implementer
- **Description:** `LandingCta`'s `entering={FadeInUp.duration(450).springify()}` (`landing-cta.tsx:40`) plays too fast to register, per QA. Increase the duration to a noticeably slower, more deliberate pace.
- **Exit criteria:** The CTA panel's `FadeInUp` duration is increased from 450ms to a value that reads as clearly slower on load (roughly 800-1000ms) — confirmed by inspecting the rendered `entering` prop/animation config, since automated timing assertions on Reanimated's native driver aren't reliable in this codebase's test setup.
- **Notes:** Exact duration is an implementation call.

### [T131] Apply the CTA's entrance animation to the screenshot showcase

- **Area:** Landing page
- **Priority:** Low
- **Status:** Not started
- **Planning:** Required
- **Description:** Screenshot items (`ScreenshotItem`, `landing-page.tsx:232`) have no entrance animation, unlike `LandingCta`'s `FadeInUp` treatment. Convert `ScreenshotItem` to an animated component using the same `FadeInUp` pattern, at the corrected (slower) duration from T130.
- **Exit criteria:** Each screenshot item renders with an `entering={FadeInUp...}` animation matching the CTA panel's corrected duration/easing. `yarn test --runInBand`, `yarn lint`, and `yarn tsc --noEmit` all pass.
- **Notes:** References T130's corrected duration value — if T130 hasn't merged yet, use the same slower duration decided there rather than today's 450ms. No hard git-level dependency; can technically be done in either order.
